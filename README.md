## About The Project

VuePress Theme Mix is a minimalistic theme that is designed and developed for [VuePress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/). It's deeply customized based on the [default theme](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next/tree/main/packages/@vuepress/theme-default) of VuePress 2, but it's not inherited from the default theme, so it's able to be used in an inherited way as well.
