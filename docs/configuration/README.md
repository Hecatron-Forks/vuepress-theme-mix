# Configuration

In addition to the theme configuration, other theme-independent configuration items can be found in the official VuePress 2 documentation at [Reference > VuePress > Configuration](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/config.html) .

The theme configuration items are all located in the `themeConfig` property of the configuration object, and because of the support for i18n, these configration items can also be used in `themeConfig.locales` .
