## ðŸš€ A Quick Start

First of all, you need to install VuePress Theme Mix in your VuePress 2 project by running:

```sh:no-line-numbers
yarn add -D vuepress-theme-mix@latest
```

And then setting the theme in `docs/.vuepress/config.ts` file:

```ts{9-11}:no-line-numbers
// docs/.vuepress/config.ts
import { defineUserConfig } from 'vuepress'
import { mixTheme } from 'vuepress-theme-mix'

export default defineUserConfig({
  // â€¦â€¦

  // Theme Config
  theme: mixTheme({
    // â€¦â€¦
  }),

  // â€¦â€¦
})
```

Finally, you are ready to create content as described in the documentation. :beers:
